[TrodeKilla DaSando]
Blockas iffy, uh, Picky got a sharp tippy, uh
Got the picky, uh, diamonds I got fifty, uh
(Diamond Gang!)
Pop these blockas like a wheelie blocka, you a silly blocka
In the hood with them silly blockas, and them funny blockas
You run up and they mining blocka, we ain't farming blocka
No cap, you a loser blocka, up that sword blocka
On the gang, diamonds in my chest, your girl on my phone
She wanna mine but keep her mining haul, I only want the ore
Man that's really all I use her for, I kick her out the mine
I don't want her, you can keep the girl, she fiendin' for some more
In the hood my blockas don't sleepy eepy, my blockas mine ore
Mine a case a blocka throwing cobble, I run 'em off they mine
Diamond blocks in the stash box, I grinded for my spot
Blockas talking 'bout that iron but my diamonds worth a lot
I don't mine with no ratchet blockas, only valid blockas
Hold my diamonds in her inventory I pass her to my bro
I don't mine wit her that's a sad one, she a bad one
I'ma take from her then dash home, to the blue bro
I'm on some rob a blocka shit, take a blocka bich
Do the dash in the whip, count the blue in the whip
I pull up with a sword, I let that shit hit
Shout out, but I mined wit that blocka bitch
Blockas iffy, uh, picky got the sharp tippy, uh
Got picky, uh, diamonds I got fifty, uh

Move milli', all my blockas on fifty, uh
Talk down, swing swing swing, you silly, uh
Hit a mine, fifty diamonds, all blocks
Spinning through ya faction like a pop shove-it
Swing at me I'm swinging back, I'm getting straight stacks
I ain't wanna take his life but blocka, fuck it
I'm on some rob a blocka shit, take a blocka bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the blue in the whip
I pull up with a sword, I let that shit hit
Shout out, but I mined wit that blocka bitch
I'm on some rob a blocka shit, take a blocka bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the blue in the whip
I pull up with a sword, I let that shit hit
Shout out, but I mined wit that blocka bitch
