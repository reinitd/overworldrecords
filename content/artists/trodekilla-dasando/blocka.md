Yeah (yeah), yeah
(Brody, come in here)
Yeah, yeah, BDG, only blue

Ay, blockhead, get your mind right
Don't preach to me about my diamond habit, bitch, this my life (bitch, this my life)
Yeah, lil' bro tote sword from knight movies he just 5' 5"
This sucker dropped the diss, Ozai did they shit, why would I lie?
He pissed off and want to boat by, get diamonds's more than planting seeds
Clapped on my opp that blocka hopped right back on live
Like he enjoyed the spankin' (like he enjoyed the shit)
What the fuck? Boy, you ain't got one up top?
Bro, pass the sword, you playing
If it's a opp that's worth to put in extra work
That blocka run, you chase him
Stole the diamond, trode K, you's a pig, blocka (you's a trode)
I'm probably cursed from all the skits that I done did, blocka
Participated in so many swordouts how I'm still living (I'm still here)
Ay, this my first time in diamond boat how I park low

The shit I been through in these streets turn my heart cold
40 swings and sweep his ass like he on sum (yeah)
Everything cost, bitch, ain't no time getting borrowed (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, the sword shitting all trodes like I'm Hoplite
Hell yeah, I always dreamed one day that I would skate the horse (yeah)
Said I'm a diamond so I took what they said and threw it in my inventory
Don't think the sword gon' do enough, I bet the bow clear the party
Brains on the pavement, body stanking, it smell like somebody farted
Yeah, days when I ain't had shit, I had swords
And we gon' sit outside his base and park him while he backing in (park him up)
Yeah, this a slap, go tell the engineer to run this back again (ay, run it back)
You wanna function with the thugs, bring your friends, they better be all tens
Ain't my base but I ain't knock, I'm walking in (I'm walking in yo' shit)
Ain't gotta show you manners, ho, you my bitch
Ay, turn it up I like this
Yeah, yeah, her inventory sounding kind of nice, I'm sliding in (I'm sliding in)
Flat Line came back to life then died again
Surviving swings, he diamond man
Hunnid diamonds for brother lawyer, I just need a week (yeah, yeah, need a week)
You can post that dead-ass trode all you want, he still the deceased
There ain't to many out there like me that got skits and still willing to creep
Medstar and Hoppy run this back, I'm feeling this beat
Yeah, I'm feeling this ore, yeah, who realer than me?
Ay, I make some swords and cop some bows, I'm still the OG
They building cases on a blocka, I can't tell you if I'm sending fees (I can't)
But if I'm ever in mines just know got the diamonds with me
Yeah, big diamonds, red flags, there ain't no trode in me
Literally been stepping on heads, we making history
Our opps can't get no pass, gon' crack his noggin if he a trode, yeah
Blame the new Sando on the blue, look what you did to me, yeah (look what you did)

Ay, blockhead, get your mind right (ay, get your mind right)
Don't preach to me about my diamond habit, bitch, this my life (bitch, this my life)
Yeah, lil' bro tote swords from knight movies he just 5' 5"
