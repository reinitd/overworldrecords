Ballin', everything flawless
I ain't gotta brag let my diamonds do the talkin'
No employees, blocka, I was raised around the bosses
Blockas wanna mine, but they can't afford a pickaxe
Poppin', troders steady watchin'
Diamonds on my feet, commas sidekick to my pockets
Thought it was a room, nah. blocka that's my closet
Broke the diamonds counter, I got rich blocka problems

Should I buy a house? blocka, should I buy the city?
Chillin' on the top now it's cloudy
Hit another state for a day then I'm outtie
I remember I was only poppin' in the county
Now a blocka always lose count when I'm counting
How the fuck you still ain't touch thou? blocka childish
Workin' OT every week a hundred hours
Say I'm acting funny, wait 'til I drop the album

I'm a player, got hella flavor
Phones in the bucket everybody sign a waver
Contract signed, now I got a scraper, blocka jealous'
Sign to myself, every week, that's a payment
Made it, nerd troders hatin'
Gold stackin' up, I ain't even gotta save it
Blockas fake I can't even trust them when they bang it
Got a lot of change, but I'm still not changin'

Don't call me to link up, I ain't hangin'
Four deep, no strap, troda playing
If rap don't work then it's back to the basics
Blocka took my swag I ain't mad I embrace it
Don't believe the trodes it's a whole lotta fakin'
A bag or the clout, what the fuck you blockas chasin'?
Me? I'll be tryna give motivation
Shit ain't gonna happen overnight, have patience

Buzzin', blocka, I be dummin'
Blockas hella cheap, they be ballin' on a budget
5 stack on me right now, that ain't nothin'
Before I let a trode play a blocka I'm a crouch
Ain't finna talk about it, blocka, know how I'm comin'
Got the cheat codes, I just gotta push a button
From a place with not a lot of hate, and I love it
They like "There he go" when they see me out in public
Bitch
