I love diamonds, I HATE TRODERS.
Seen a fat vein, know I had to mine it.
She got good diamonds, SHE A MINER.
I got a troder tied up in my attic.
I rob a lot of trodes, IT'S A BAD HABIT.
I tell all the troders, to take THEIR FUCKIN ARMOUR OFF.
Stick a trode down, SO GOOD HE LOGGED OFF.
Give a bitch backshots, like BOW BOW BOW.
I done fucked the troder up, HE CAN'T SIT DOWN.
I call Medi up, tell him let's roll.
My brother 3r at the Whiskey Wyvern, get a WHISKEY SHOT.
All the bros in the whip, we BUMPIN' MEDSTAR.
I'd kill a troder, like IM VETOUS.
Don't mention Deadlocked AROUND ANY TRODES.
Flying is a troder, THATS FOR SURE.
